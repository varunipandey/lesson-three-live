        <h2 class="blog-post-heading"> A list of not so common resources to make life of fellow web developer beginners easier </h2>
        <p class="blog-para">
            Starting to learn web development can be quite overwhelming. The initial joy of seeing the simple html page you created can
            easily and usually without fail turns into a living monster residing in your computer and your head. Dependencies,
            inheritance, CSS – the big pretty monster, the necessary evil, the friction of computer science, (No offense
            to any CSS lovers, I myself love me some CSS!), and plethora of frameworks are more than ready to confuse us
            and make us doubt our progress.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-para">
            Hence I wanted to list out some not so common list of resources which can help upcoming developers and maybe make their life
            a little easier.
            <br>
            <br> Disclaimer: This is not a list of tutorials because as I think there are a lot of YouTube videos and blogs already
            present which discuss this topic in much more detail.

        </p>
        <p class="blog-para"> Without further ado, let’s dive right into it. </p>

        <h3 class="blog-para-heading">Undraw.co | Open-source illustrations for any idea you can imagine and create</h3>
        <p class="blog-para"> Launched in 2017, it contains a huge collection of illustrations which you can use in any project, commercial or
            personal without attribution or any costs. A life saver in all its open source glory! It has a built-in search
            functionality which lets you search images based on keywords. There is something there for everyone and downloads
            are available in both PNG and SVG formats.
        </p>

        <h3 class="blog-para-heading">Unsplash.com | Photos for everyone </h3>
        <p class="blog-para"> This website contains the most beautiful free pictures and images, which have been gifted to them by a community of photographers. The pictures from here are a sure way to give your website the professional look you strive for. From abstract art to gorgeous looking café interiors, from Paris to Canada, they got your back.
        </p>

        <h3 class="blog-para-heading">FunTranslations.com | Translation APIs </h3>
        <p class="blog-para"> Funtranslations.com gives you access to their huge collection of easy to use translation APIs from Minion language to Dothraki accompanied with a document on how to use them in your projects. Hence making translation app a very good choice for a personal project.  For your reference here are two translation projects I made. 
        </p>

        <h3 class="blog-para-heading">Netlify.com | Web hosting made easy  </h3>
        <p class="blog-para"> Netlify is a web hosting platform. It simplifies the process for developers to deploy and host a website. Netlify works by connecting to your GitHub repository to pull your source code, then it typically runs a build process to deploy it on its own. The best part about Netlify though is that it supports continuous delivery and continuous integration. You just have to connect it to a git repo and every time a developer pushes a commit, it will automatically build the site, run plugins, and deploy. Talk about a job done easy, it doesn’t get easier than this folks. 
        </p>

        <h3 class="blog-para-heading">CodeSandBox | The Online Editor </h3>
        <p class="blog-para"> CodeSandbox is an online editor for rapid web development. You can use it to create static sites, full-stack web apps or components, on any device with a web browser. This not only makes it easier to get started but also makes it easier to share. You can just share your created work by sharing the URL. For beginners learning React it is a God-send (pardon my hyperbole), because with a tool like CodeSandbox you don’t have to learn how bash works, or what npm is, or what node stands for. You can just open a web page and start hacking away. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="blog-para">This is of course not an exhaustive list of resources, there is a mountain of such resources available just a few correct google keywords away.  But I hope the list I got here makes your life easier in the same way it did mine. <br><br>
                If you know some more awesome websites please share away. I would be happy to chat on twitter on all things web development. <br>
                Happy Coding!
